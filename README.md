# Charity Tasker

This project was initially created with the focus of providing more donations to several charities through aa social media platform. The goal was to have a website where the challenges need to be completed once donations have reached their goals. 

It was created using MERN - MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js.

## Currently waiting on Deployment:

This should be completed using Heroku for the front end, and Netify for the back-end.
